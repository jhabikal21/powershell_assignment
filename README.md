# powershell_assignment

Hi,

Preferred language to script this will be PowerShell but we are okay with any language of your choice if below task is accomplished.

You will find 
a) 2 Windows Registry file with name suffix _WithPlaceHolder.REG
b) InformationForVariableReplacement.txt which contain variables value. 

The task is to create a script which replaces the variable values as below:
1) Replace all the variable defined in file (a). ex. Variables are defined as %%APP_DESTINATION_SERVER%%
2) look for the values in file (b). ex. %%APP_DESTINATION_SERVER%% with "xyz.server.net,443"
3) For any variables not defined in file (b) should become blank. ex, %%APP_DESTINATION_ID%% with ""
4) After above changes, rename the file. ex, DSN_WithPlaceHolder.REG to DSN.REG

Mandatory thing is to document the step and research activities on what worked and what didn't work with error. 

If you are unable to achieve above task, its okay but we would require you to make us understand the efforts you made to furnish this activities. 
Note: Request you to complete and send the code within 3 working days and have the setup ready for walkthrough during next round
